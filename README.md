# Nearest Neighbor analysis of particles in cryo-electron tomograms

Distances and orientation between particles and their density calculated from coordinates and angles generated through template matching and subtomogram averaging.
It mainly works on motive lists (.star files) from STOPGAP but can easily be adjusted. After changing the file path to your .star file the code can directly be executed.
