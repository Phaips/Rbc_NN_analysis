# Nearest Neighbor analysis for particles in cryo-electron tomograms

Distances and orientation between particles calculated from coordinates and angles generated through template matching and subtomogram averaging.
It mainly works on motive lists (.star files) from STOPGAP but can easily be adjusted. After changing the file path the code can directly be executed.
